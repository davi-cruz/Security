# Sentinel Connectors

Collectors I've built for Sentinel for demonstration puposes or based on a specific customer scenario.
These are not official connectors, and are not supported by Microsoft. Use at your own risk.

## 3rd Party Security Alerts

Jupyter notebook to generate Security Alerts from 3rd party source, like a SIEM, and send them to Sentinel. This is a sample only, and not a supported connector.

## CEF-VMSS-TLS

TLS Enabled VMSS Connector for CEF Logs. While still under development, it can help you get started with a TLS enabled VMSS for external services, like Trend Micro Deep Security

## Codeless Connector Platform (CCP) Samples

Collection of CCP Samples for Sentinel. These can be used for learning purposes along with the sample functions in [Functions](../../Functions) for learning how to build your own connectors.
